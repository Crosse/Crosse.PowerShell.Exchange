        This message is being sent to your student Dukes email account
        (@dukes.jmu.edu) to make you aware that you now also have a JMU
        Exchange faculty/staff account. Exchange accounts are created
        for all employees, Teaching Assistants, Graduate Assistants and
        upon request for some student employees. Instructions for
        logging in and setting up your Exchange account can be found at
        <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/computing/email">http://www.jmu.edu/computing/email</a>
        under "Faculty and Staff".

        <br/><br/>

        You can log into your Exchange account by going to
        <a href="https://exchange.jmu.edu/">https://exchange.jmu.edu/</a>
        and logging in with your e-ID and the same password you use for MyMadison.

        <br/><br/>

        With the creation of this account, you will need to check both your
        Exchange email and your Dukes email accounts regularly. Typically, JMU
        work-related correspondence will come to your Exchange account and
        student/academic information to your Dukes account. Please discuss
        proper usage of your Exchange account with your supervisor.

        <br/><br/>

        When you leave employment, you will no longer have access to this
        account for messages, calendar, contacts, etc.   Be sure to forward any
        messages you wish to retain and change job recruitment and resume email
        addresses to your Dukes email account.

        <br/><br/>

        The email address for your Exchange account is [[EmailAddress]].
