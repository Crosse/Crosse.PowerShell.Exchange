        <p>
        You have been identified as an owner / delegate for the
        following Exchange resource:

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[ResourceDisplayName]]

        <p>
        This email is to inform you about the booking policy for this
        resource and how you can change the defaults if they do not
        suit the resource.  By default the resource will automatically
        accept booking requests that do not conflict with other bookings
        and will require approval for requests that have a conflict.

        <p>
        If you would like to change this behavior, you may do so by
        using Outlook Web App (OWA).  Open Internet Explorer and
        navigate to the following URL:

        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
            href="https://exchange.jmu.edu/owa/[[ResourceEmailAddress]]">https://exchange.jmu.edu/owa/[[ResourceEmailAddress]]</a>

        <p>
        Log in using your e-ID and password.
