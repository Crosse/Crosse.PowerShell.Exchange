        Welcome to JMU's Microsoft Exchange email system, the
        university's official means of electronic communication.
        Exchange provides faculty and staff with "anywhere access" to a
        system that integrates email, calendar, contacts and tasks. It
        also supports web access and a variety of desktop clients as
        well as mobile devices that utilize ActiveSync.

        <br/><br/>

        The Exchange email system provides:

        <ul>
            <li>a storage quota of 1.5 GB</li>
            <li>an integrated Global Address List (GAL) that includes
                students, faculty, and staff</li>
            <li>the ability to recover deleted items for up to 60
                days</li>
            <li>a consistent Microsoft Outlook experience across desktop
                and browser clients</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
