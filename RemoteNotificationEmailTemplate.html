        This message is being sent to your Exchange email account
        (@jmu.edu) to make you aware that you now also have a JMU
        student Dukes account (@dukes.jmu.edu).  Dukes accounts are
        automatically created for all students. Instructions for logging
        in and connecting to your Dukes account and more can be found at
        <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/computing/email">http://www.jmu.edu/computing/email</a>
        under "Students and Alumni".

        <br/><br/>

        With the creation of this account, you will need to check both your
        Exchange email and your Dukes email accounts regularly. Typically,
        JMU work-related correspondence will come to your Exchange account
        and student/academic information to your Dukes account. If you feel
        that this account has been created in error, please contact the JMU
        Computing HelpDesk at
        <a href="mailto:helpdesk@jmu.edu">helpdesk@jmu.edu</a> or
        540-568-3555.
        <br/><br/>

        The address for your Dukes account is [[EmailAddress]].

        <br/><br/>

        <em>
        Note: the password for your Dukes account is separate from your e-ID password
        and is not bound by the 90 day e-ID password change requirement.
        </em>
